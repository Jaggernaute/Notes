An [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) markdown vault containing notes on the things I learned and useful resources.

The `.osidian/` directory contains all my obsidian configs.

All those notes are in constant evolution, so everything is WIP (*Work In Progress*). If you find a typo don't hesitate to do a PR, and if you don't understand something or you find that I don't go deep enough in something open an issue (I'll be happy to address the issue).
